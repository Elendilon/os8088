"""EMS.DRV, as a package sees it - SPEC.md 107.7.

    make emstest && python3 tests/ems.py [--leg board|none|both]

ON MARTYPC, which models a LO-TECH 2 MB EMS BOARD
(`os8088_5150_herc_hdd_sb_ems_gla`: registers 260h-263h, frame E000h) - an
8088 with expanded memory, the machine class this driver is for. Nothing here
is timed; every wait is on guest state.

LEG board (that machine):
  1. the driver's row is LOADED, its error DRVE_OK - the probe found the
     board at the first base of the first frame it tried;
  2. EMSTEST's first instance: IDENT, CAPS (128 pages, all free, frame
     E000h, four quarters free), ALLOC 3 -> handle 1, ALLOC 0 refused BAD,
     ALLOC past the board refused ROOM, FRAME all four (the recipe: 260h, a
     step of 1, nothing to OR), pages 0..2 mapped and signed through the
     frame, page 0 seen through quarter 3, BASE, page 1 mapped into quarter 3
     by the PACKAGE'S OWN OUT, and CAPS after (125 free, no quarter free);
  3. the frame READ OFF THE EMULATOR, not taken from the package: E000:0000
     holds page 0's signature and E000:C000 page 1's;
  4. a SECOND instance is refused the quarters (BUSY) and the first's handle
     (BAD), and its BX comes back DRVC_EMS:verb - the kernel handed the
     driver its instance slot in BH, and the driver put the class back;
  5. both closed WITHOUT freeing anything, then a THIRD instance finds every
     page and every quarter free again - EMSV_GONE, from xm_release_rec.
LEG none (`os8088_5150_herc_hdd_sb_gla`, the same machine with no board):
  the row is not loaded, its error DRVE_HW, and EMSTEST says nobody answered.

VERIFIED TO FAIL: with xm_release_rec's EMSV_GONE call taken out, step 5's
third instance is a LATER one (125 free); with drv_pkg_call_x's slot swap
taken out, step 4's FRAME and FREE are both ACCEPTED - every caller is
"class 7" and so every caller owns every handle and every quarter.
