"""WireArena's lift carries whoever stands on it, however they got there
(docs/plans/WIREARENA-HEIGHTS-PLAN.md 3.2, 7.4.4, 9.10).

The owner, on the pc5150 in the Heights arena: "The lift just 'jitters' me in
place when I stand on it, never lifting me up to the tower." The cause was in
`wa_hjump`'s cached floor read: on a still tick with the floor's box the lift,
it branched to `.read` with the LIFT'S RECORD in AX where `.read` takes x - so
it read the floor at x = 40, the ground, every other tick. The feet went
16, 0, 16, 0 (the jitter), `wa_ltick` saw a rider on the ground every other
tick and reset its count, and the lift never started. It worked only while
the rider's x or y changed every tick - a moving rider reads the floor
through the other branch, with AX right.

So every ride here ends with the player STILL on the lift - the case that
broke - and each checks, tick by tick off the game's own variables:

  - the lift reached its raised height (wa_ltop) and the feet with it;
  - the feet never went DOWN during the ride (the jitter was exactly that);
  - the rider walked off south onto the tower and stood there at its height;
  - with nobody on it, the lift came back to its rest height (wa_lrest).

The rides: backed on and every key released; walked on with the mouse
turning the view during the rise; W kept held into the tower's face (it
walks on by itself once the lift is within a step); arrived by a jump;
standing on its west edge (square half on the ground) and on its north
edge. Three more: a rider who walks off mid-rise falls to the ground and the
lift goes home; a rider who steps back onto it from the tower holds it up,
still; and one who drops onto it from the tower as it comes down stops it
and is carried back up (it never carries anyone DOWN: 3.2, it holds while
occupied).

`--frames DIR` also writes each tick's picture (30 a second) of the first
ride as PNGs, for a video of it.
