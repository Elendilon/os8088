"""rombig - kern_big finds its `.cold` in ROM, and the VGA decoder moves down.

docs/plans/ROM-PLAN.md wave 3 (3.4, 3.6): the shipped kernel boots the same
off any disk with or without the 5150's U28-U32 ROM, as kern_small has since
wave 2 (tests/romsmall.py). kern_big adds two things kern_small has not got:

  * SPEC.md 5.4.1.3's `.vgabuf` rung, which sits ABOVE the cold rung - so a
    floor that dropped by the cold rung alone would land under live buffers.
    The ROM re-points the decoder's ONE segment load (vga12.inc,
    `mov ax, VGABUF_SEG`) at the bottom of the dead cold rung, and the floor
    falls to COLD_RAM + VGABUF_PARA: the whole rung back, buffers kept;
  * hibernate, whose image would carry every far reference into the ROM.
    The pointer file's pad byte says where `.cold` ran (SPEC.md 2.10.4), and
    resume compares it as part of the head it always compared, so a ROM image
    and a RAM image refuse each other. Not driven here: hibernate is its own
    rows' subject, and this byte rides the comparison they already make.

Five boots of the shipped 360KB disks:

  A. CGA 5150 (GLaBIOS), the ROM `tools/os88rom.py kernel` cuts from build/:
     [api_coldseg] = F401, [mem_base] = COLD_RAM (no VGA: the `.vgabuf` arm
     has already taken its rung, and the cold rung goes too), rom_mfp =
     F400:x, the Control Panel opens and CTRL.DRV's listed words say F401.
  B. CGA, no ROM: [api_coldseg] = COLD_RAM, [mem_base] = HEAP_SEG - VGABUF_PARA.
  C. CGA, a ROM whose `.cold` is one byte off this kernel's: refused, exactly B
     - the negative control (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1).
  D. the VGA XT (GLaBIOS XT), with the ROM: F401, [mem_base] = COLD_RAM +
     VGABUF_PARA, the decoder's segment word reads COLD_RAM - and the decoder
     is DRIVEN: Paint repaints a dithered picture off the byte grid
     (tests/blitplane.py's scene), a breakpoint on vga_blit_prow's
     `mov ds, ax` must see AX = COLD_RAM on every row it decodes, and the
     screen after it must be pixel-identical to E's.
  E. the VGA XT, no ROM: the same session, the reference frame, and AX =
     VGABUF_RAM at the same breakpoint.
