; tests/picomem/sbhx.asm - SOUND.DRV's PicoMEM attach and SB IRQ choice,
; alone, for tests/picomem.py (SPEC.md 34.10, 34.10.1). picomem.inc is
; %included AS IT SHIPS; sbl_f_irqdisc and its candidate tables are CUT OUT
; of sb.inc by the row (sbslice.inc) rather than copied here, so the code
; under test is the code that ships. Everything else is the minimum they
; read - and every DSP or tick primitive is a stub that RECORDS being
; called, because on a PicoMEM the probe must not run at all.
