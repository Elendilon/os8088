;
; VIDDISK: what STREAMING a large file off the fixed disk costs, on the
; machine it runs on (docs/plans/VIDEO-PLAN.md wave 0 (b), and what waves 2
; and 3 added to the question).
;
;   python3 tests/viddisk.py [--machine os8088_5150_herc_hdd_sb_gla]
;   python3 tests/viddisk.py --floppy     (the 360 KB field floppy's path)
;
; THE STREAM is the first of STREAM.DAT, BADAPPLE.V88 or BAPPLE.V88 that is at
; least 12 MB + 32 KB long - the emulator row makes a STREAM.DAT, the owner's
; field image carries BADAPPLE.V88, and the encoder's VGA disk BAPPLE.V88.
; WHERE it is looked for depends on where the bench is: beside itself on a
; fixed disk (drive C: or after), as the field VHDs have it, and in C:'s ROOT
; when the bench runs off a floppy - which is `make viddisk360`, the 360 KB
; disk for a machine nobody can copy 12 MB onto (docs/plans/VIDEO-PLAN.md
; 15.8). With none, the file rows say so and skip, and the int 13h rows still
; run. Every row is tick-timed (benchlib's method T: a disk call is tens of
; milliseconds and more).
;
; W  MAKES the stream: STREAM.DAT, 12.5 MB, every dword its own offset in the
;    file, written where R will look for it in 32 KB calls of the HELD
;    streaming write (OSAPI_FILE_WRITE_SEQ, WSEQF_HELD, SPEC.md 18.4.9): no
;    walk, and the FAT and the entry written once at the close. It checks the
;    room first, and it RESUMES - a STREAM.DAT that is a whole number of
;    chunks short of 12.5 MB is carried on from its end, so a write
;    interrupted by a reset costs only what was not written. It reports its
;    own rate (KB/s x 10, the whole write) and WHICH WRITER made it, and
;    saves the report as VDWRITE.TXT beside the bench.
; A  the same with OSAPI_FILE_APPEND, the old writer, which walks the chain
;    to its last cluster every call (SPEC.md 18.4.7.3) and slows as the file
;    grows: the A/B. It was W until 2026-10-07, when the owner read ~30 KB/s
;    off the ST-225 and could not tell from the report that it was APPEND.
;    P is WRITE_SEQ PLAIN (committed every call) and H is W again; U, I, K
;    and F are the held stream's edge cases, for tests/viddisk.py.
; D  deletes STREAM.DAT again, so the disk gets its 12.5 MB back.
; X  EXTENDED MEMORY (docs/plans/VIDEO-XMS-PLAN.md 3.2): what a stream's read-
;    ahead BANK in XMS would cost this machine. OSAPI_XMEM_COPY up and down
;    at 32, 16, 8 and 4 KB a call, PIT-timed with the copy's own interrupts-
;    off window inside the span (on a 286 the copy is int 15h AH=87h, and the
;    whole of it is masked) - after a CHECK that a 32 KB round trip comes back
;    the same bytes, because a copy that times well and moves the wrong ones
;    is not a measurement. Then, if the stream is there, the bank's FILL: 5 s
;    of 32 KB READ_SEQ calls with nothing else, and 5 s of the same with each
;    chunk copied up behind the last, KB/s x 10 - the two rows' ratio is
;    what banking a byte costs over reading it, and the copy rows say how the
;    copy's cost splits into a call's fixed part and its bytes. Saves
;    VDXMS.TXT beside the bench; writes nothing else, and frees the block.
; E  EXPANDED MEMORY (docs/plans/VIDEO-XMS-PLAN.md 10): a LO-TECH-STYLE EMS
;    board - four WRITE-ONLY page registers, each mapping a 16 KB page into
;    one quarter of a 64 KB frame - found where EMS.DRV finds one (frames
;    E000h, D000h, C000h at bases 260h, 264h, 268h, 26Ch and 288h): MartyPC's
;    model, 86Box's "Lo-tech EMS Board", and a PicoMEM's EMS at its own
;    defaults, D000h at 288h. The row after the title says where it answered.
;    THE PROBE READS FIRST:
;    an option ROM anywhere in the frame (55h AAh on a 2 KB boundary) is
;    somebody else's, and E says so and writes NO PORT. Then it maps pages 0
;    and 1, writes each,
;    and maps page 0 into both quarters: paging is proven only if the second
;    quarter then reads page 0's byte. The board is sized by a signature per
;    page, written from page 127 DOWN (a smaller board aliases, and the lowest
;    write to a physical page is its own number). Then: four OUTs mapping the
;    whole frame, 16 KB rep movsw frame -> RAM, RAM -> frame and RAM -> RAM,
;    and - if the stream is there - 5 s of 32 KB READ_SEQ into RAM against 5 s
;    of the same STRAIGHT INTO THE FRAME, a new pair of pages each chunk, the
;    last chunk checked against STREAM.DAT's pattern through the frame. That
;    last pair is the question VIDEO-XMS-PLAN 10 turns on: whether a disk read
;    can fill a bank with no copy at all. Saves VDEMS.TXT beside the bench.
;
; With a STREAM.DAT, R also CHECKS the data at 12 MB, read by READ_AT and by
; READ_SEQ: a stream that times well and reads the wrong bytes is not a
; measurement.
;
;   READ_AT 32K @n MB     OSAPI_FILE_READ_AT at 0..12 MB. It re-walks the
;                         chain from the front every call (SPEC.md 18.4.4),
;                         so it GROWS with the offset: wave 0's slope.
;   READ_SEQ ...          OSAPI_FILE_READ_SEQ (SPEC.md 18.4.8): a SEEK's
;                         first call (one walk, timed alone), then 32 KB
;                         calls from where it stands, at 0 MB and at 12 MB -
;                         which should not differ - and 16 KB and 8 KB calls,
;                         which price a call's fixed part.
;   int 13h per 32 KB     the fixed disk's int 13h calls one 32 KB READ_SEQ
;                         makes at 12 MB, and how many land under cylinder 16
;                         (the FAT and the root). A run split at every track
;                         shows here as calls; a chain being re-read, as low
;                         ones.
;   ceiling at n%         THE SILENT PLAYER'S DISK (SPEC.md 98.3): inside an
;                         FSXF_RATE bracket at 30 Hz, a hook that holds n% of
;                         every period with interrupts ON - as the player's
;                         decode does - while the foreground streams 32 KB
;                         READ_SEQ calls for 5 s. KB/s. And one 50% row with
;                         interrupts OFF, which is what the difference is on
;                         a DMA controller: its completion interrupt waits.
;   int13 track / sector  the ROM's own int 13h on unit 80h, a whole track and
;                         one sector: the controller's ceiling.
;   across a head / cyl   DOES THE ROM CARRY ONE CALL ONTO THE NEXT HEAD? The
;                         kernel ends every fixed-disk run at the track
;                         (SPEC.md 52.1, disk.inc's run loop), so a 32 KB
;                         READ_SEQ is ~5 calls on a 17-sector disk and each
;                         pays the call's set-up and half a turn. A run read
;                         a track a call is the truth; the same run in ONE
;                         call, into a buffer filled with a pattern first,
;                         must checksum the same - a ROM that answers CF=0
;                         for a short or a wrong-head read reads as WRONG
;                         BYTES, which is the failure that would be silent in
;                         the kernel. Across a head, then across a cylinder.
;   N sectors one call    ...and what it buys: the same N sectors (a whole
;   / a call a track      cylinder, or 40 KB) from sector 1 of fresh
;                         cylinders, in one call and a call a track. Only
;                         timed in one call when the crossing read was right.
;
; R IS READ-ONLY: it writes nothing but VIDDISK.TXT, its report, beside
; itself. Only W writes (STREAM.DAT and VDWRITE.TXT) and only D deletes
; (STREAM.DAT). It calls int 13h itself because it is a bench; the player
; never does.
