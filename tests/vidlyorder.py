"""THE LAYER BEFORE THE BASE'S BANK - SPEC.md 98.1.9.1, on QEMU.

    make && python3 tests/vidlyorder.py [--arm layer|bank]

WHY QEMU: docs/TESTING.md's closed list, entry 1 - XMS is a 286-and-up
store and every MartyPC machine is an 8088.

A file with a LAYER and a base BANK, bigger than `-m 2`'s pool so the base
takes a bank and not a hold: 28 seconds of Life made for a 20 KB/s disk with
a 256 KB bank and no prefill, its layer for 60 KB/s. The encode models the
faster machine reading the layer BEFORE it refills the base's bank, which
makes the header's layer-order byte 1, and the player reads in that order:
its ring, then the layer's slots, then the bank. B: is throttled, so the
order is seen happening.

The play is held before frame 20 (vp_stopat): the hook takes nothing more,
the ring is full, and the reader goes on to the bank - the layer's slots
having been filled before the first frame, in either order. With the bank
part full the layer's slots are marked TAKEN ([vp_lyuse] moved on by all of
them), and what the reader refills first is the order:

ARM layer: the layer's slots are full again before the bank takes more
than ONE chunk while they had room - the one it was reading when they were
marked - and the layer was read. Every look is taken with the machine
stopped, so the figure is the order and not the looks' interval.

The layer comes first only while the bank holds what the faster machine
needs to carry the base (the header's H_LYNEED, this clip's a slot or two),
which the bank is well past when the slots are marked.

ARM bank: the NEGATIVE CONTROL and the threshold's own test - [vp_lyneed]
poked past the bank's size before Play, so the bank is always short of it:
the bank goes on filling first, as every file before was read, which is
also what says the instrument tells the two orders apart.
