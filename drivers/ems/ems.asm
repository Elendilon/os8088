; EMS.DRV: EXPANDED MEMORY on a LIM EMS board's page registers (SPEC.md 107).
;
; A board has four page registers. Writing one maps a 16 KB page of the board
; into one QUARTER of a 64 KB FRAME below 1 MB, and the CPU then reads and
; writes that page as ordinary memory - so nothing here ever moves a byte. This
; driver finds the board, keeps who owns which of its pages and which quarter
; of its frame, and maps on request; the package does the rest in the frame
; itself (docs/plans/VIDEO-XMS-PLAN.md 10 is the design record, and the
; measurement that a disk read lands in the frame at the disk's own rate).
;
; ONE REGISTER FAMILY, the CONSECUTIVE one (SPEC.md 107.2): quarter q's
; register at base + q, a page's value its number. The Lo-tech 2 MB board,
; MartyPC's model of it, 86Box's "Lo-tech EMS Board" and a PicoMEM's EMS. The
; registers are WRITE-ONLY, so nothing here ever reads one: the driver knows
; what it wrote, and a quarter's holder knows what IT wrote (107.4).
;
; Reached by packages through OSAPI_DRV_CALL (BH = DRVC_EMS), and by the
; kernel for one verb, EMSV_GONE, with ES = KERNEL_SEG (xm_release_rec). The
; kernel hands this class the CALLER'S INSTANCE SLOT in BH, where every other
; class gets its own class number - so every verb puts DRVC_EMS back in BH
; before it returns, and the BX a package called with is the BX it gets.
;
; ONE KILOBYTE (kernel size pass 11). The image was 1,208 bytes and drv_load
; claims a driver in whole KB, so it took two. 256 of them were a per-page
; owner table that only repeated the handles: a handle IS one contiguous run
; (first page, length), so a page is owned exactly when it lies inside a live
; handle's run, and first fit asks the eight handles instead (em_alloc).

; moment before - drv_load_row refuses a row whose DRVR_SEG is set, which is
; the fact HDD.DRV lays its attach code under hd_mbr on. So the 34 bytes
