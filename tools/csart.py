"""CLEAR SKIES' title-screen art (SPEC.md 88.10): the 1bpp bands, generated.

    python3 tools/csart.py -o apps/skies/csart.inc [--preview DIR]

The launcher is a white page with the title lettered across the top and the
AEROPLANE IN USE in front of a cumulus on the right - a band per aircraft,
which a plane record names in CSP_ART (SPEC.md 88.10.1) - and all of them
are DRAWN HERE, as vectors: the lettering as brush strokes (a black stroke
and a narrower white one over it, which is what makes a letter an outline
with a white centre), an aeroplane as filled shapes that hide the cloud
behind them and the lines that make it an aeroplane. Each is rasterised
ONCE into the framebuffer's own 1bpp bit order, so the window puts it up
with a single OSAPI_GFX_BLIT1 (apps/os88api.inc) instead of the four hundred
line calls the drawing would be on an 8088, at SPEC.md 5.6's price each. A
set bit is a LIT pixel there, so the bands carry paper as 1 and ink as 0:
right on a 1bpp adapter as they are, and right on VGA under the blit's
default pen.

EACH AIRCRAFT IS SEEN FROM ITS OWN ANGLE, because a row of side elevations
reads as one drawing with the parts moved around. A side elevation is drawn
flat, in canvas pixels; anything else is written as a MODEL in body
coordinates and projected, the angle being three numbers - see `View` and
`model` below.

The output is checked in and `tests/unit/t_csart.py` regenerates it and
compares, so the include cannot drift from this file. --preview writes every
band as a PNG, zoomed, for looking at.
