"""os88vidbuf - what a stream's read-ahead would buy, with and without XMS.

    python3 tools/os88vidbuf.py CLIP.V88 [--profile 286-speeddemon] [--media KB/s]
        [--pio MS] [--xcopy MS] [--ring K] [--xms KB ...] [--wait S ...]
        [--minrate] [--deficit KB/s ...] [--cache FILE]

AN INSTRUMENT, not a gate: docs/plans/VIDEO-XMS-PLAN.md's numbers come off
it, so they can be re-derived for any clip rather than argued about. It reads
a STREAMED .V88 (SPEC.md 98.1.4) and plays it in a model of the player's
reader (98.3) on a model of the machine, then says whether the play stalls.

THE PLAYER, as built and as VIDEO-XMS-PLAN 4 proposes it:
  - a ring of K 32 KB chunks; chunk c may be loaded while c < the hook's
    super-packet's chunk + K (vp_fill's test); a super-packet is drawable
    once every chunk it touches is in
  - with --xms, a FIFO of that many KB in extended memory AHEAD of the ring
    (the plan's "bank"): a free ring slot is filled from the bank's head
    when the bank has it (one copy DOWN), else from the disk; a full ring
    with room in the bank reads the disk into a bounce buffer and copies it
    UP. So a banked byte costs one disk read and two copies, and a byte read
    while the bank is empty costs the disk read alone - the plan's 4.2
  - the play starts once the ring and the bank are full (or the file is all
    read), or at --wait seconds, whichever comes first: that is the PREFILL

THE MACHINE, per millisecond step:
  - the decode is the hook's and runs first (it is an ISR): each frame's
    cost is the profile's own measured decode (os88venc.profile_table,
    SPEC.md 98.2.3.3) at the profile's speed
  - the reader gets what is left. A disk chunk takes the MEDIA's time and,
    on a disk the CPU copies (every AT-class controller; --pio), that much
    CPU: progress is the lesser of the two. A copy to or from XMS is CPU
    alone (--xcopy, ms a KB): int 15h AH=87h on a 286, unreal mode on a
    386 (SPEC.md 41.5). THE 286's FIGURE IS AN ESTIMATE until VIDDISK's X
    row has been run on one (VIDEO-XMS-PLAN 3.2)
  - a frame due whose super-packet is not drawable is a STALL: the clock
    waits (with a card, a pause), and the stall's length is counted

--minrate bisects the slowest MEDIA rate that plays with no stall, for each
--xms and --wait. --deficit is the ENCODER's side (VIDEO-XMS-PLAN 5): the
file's own frames are taken as what a lossless encode WANTS, a token bucket
as deep as the read-ahead is refilled at that rate, and the bytes it could
not send are summed - the share of the picture an encode at that rate would
have to leave out, before the next frames repair it.
