# WireArena: more players, a match finder, and match setup: plan

The owner, 2026-11-14:

> *"Go for more players. For the lobby, I would like both ip and a local
> broadcast to find matches. A central server browser will be a future
> item when os8088.com can host one. When you get to that interface is a
> good time to replace the current 'tons of keys' debug in the opening
> window, with the match setup. Including being able to select the arena,
> bot count, etc."*

This follows [WIREARENA-LINK-PLAN.md](WIREARENA-LINK-PLAN.md), whose
sections 4 (protocol v1) and 12 (Ethernet E1) are what it builds on.
Section 9 records what was built against it.

## 1. Decisions

- **Four participants at most: players and bots together.** WireArena has
  three figure records besides the player (`WA_NFIG`), and every renderer
  table is sized by it. So 4 players and no bots, 3 and 1, or 2 and 2.
  More is the owner's "286+ thing later" (AI-PLAN 7.1), not this plan.
- **The network carrier is UDP**, for both ways of finding a match:
  - a **broadcast** to 255.255.255.255 finds the matches on the local
    network;
  - a typed **IP address** finds one a router away.
  A host using UDP serves both at once. Raw frames (E1) cannot cross a
  router, and a raw claim stops ETHER.DRV's IP stack (SPEC.md 72.22.1), so
  a host on raw frames could not also answer by IP.
- **Raw frames stay, as the fallback for a network with no IP address**
  (no DHCP server, no static address): broadcast only, and "Join by IP"
  greyed with its reason (§47: grey a fact).
- **Packages gain UDP**: three verbs on ETHER.DRV (section 3). The driver
  already has UDP inside (`udp_send`, `udp_in`) for DHCP and DNS. What is
  new is a package port and a small receive queue.
- **The serial cable keeps protocol v1** and two players. Section 5's
  frames are larger, and at 2400 baud v1 already uses ~180 of 240 bytes a
  second.
- **The central server browser is a future item** (os8088.com hosting
  one). Section 6's match list is shaped so that a server's answers could
  be listed beside the broadcast's.

## 2. The match setup window

The opening window's text (every key the game knows, a debug list) is
replaced by the match setup:

```
  WireArena
  Arena     < Heights >        Players   (you)  RIVET-4F2A
  Bots      < 2 >                         COG-91A0
  Skill     < Normal >
  Width     < 40 columns >
  Play      < Alone | Serial | Network >
  Network   < Host | Find | Join IP >  [10.0.2.15    ]
  Matches   HEIGHTS  2/4  RIVET-4F2A   <- found ones, a line each
  [ Start ]  [ Ready ]  [ Keys... ]
```

- **Each setting is a line**: its value between arrows, changed by a
  click on either arrow or by Left/Right on the focused line, with
  Up/Down moving the focus. Enter presses the default button. It is drawn
  with `font_run` (CLAUDE.md: text is `font_run`), row by row, only what
  changed.
- **The buttons are os88ui's** (SPEC.md 13.8): Start (alone: play now;
  hosting: start when everyone is ready), Ready (a joined player), and
  Keys..., which opens the help as a dialog. The key list leaves the
  opening window but not the game.
- **The IP field is os88line's** (SPEC.md 83): the address typed there,
  remembered for next time in `SYSTEM\APPDATA` (SPEC.md 19.9).
- **What a joined player cannot change is greyed with why**: the arena,
  bots and skill are the host's ("The host picks").
- **The Game and Link menus keep their items** as a second way to the
  same settings: the menus still work, and the window shows what they
  set.
- **The width** stays each player's own, as in v1.

## 3. UDP for packages (ETHER.DRV, SPEC.md 72.24 - 72.23 was taken)

| verb | in | out |
|---|---|---|
| `NETV_UDP` 18 | AL = 1 bind CX = the port, 0 release | CF=0; CF=1 NETE_BUSY (one package port at a time) or NETE_NOLINK (no IP yet) |
| `NETV_UDPTX` 19 | SI = the payload, CX = its length (<= 512), DI = 6 bytes: the IP address, then the port | CF=0 sent; CF=1 NETE_NOLINK (no ARP answer yet: try again) |
| `NETV_UDPRX` 20 | DI = a buffer, CX = its capacity, BX = 6 bytes for the source | CF=0 CX = the true length, the source at BX; CF=1 empty |

- **A queue of 4 datagrams of up to 128 bytes** in the driver: about half
  a kilobyte of the driver's bss, which it carries for as long as it is
  loaded, whether or not a port is bound. Section 8 records the bytes.
- **`udp_in` gives the bound port's datagrams to the queue**; a full queue
  drops the newest and counts it.
- **The verbs pump**, as every other verb does: a package that polls
  NETV_UDPRX is the stack's service, inside a bracket too (SPEC.md 53.7's
  rule, for a driver attached before entry).
- **Broadcast** is the destination 255.255.255.255, which `ip_start`
  already sends to the broadcast station address (DHCP does).
- WireArena's port is **30088**.

## 4. Who is who: slots

- **A match has four slots, 0 to 3.** The host is slot 0. Joining players
  take 1, 2, 3 in the order the host accepts them. Bots take the slots
  after the players (2 players and 2 bots: 0, 1 players, 2, 3 bots).
- **A slot is the code on the wire.** That generalises v1's codes, which
  were already host 0, guest 1, bots 2 and 3. The deaths-by-cause table
  is v1's, 4 x 4, unchanged.
- **Here, the local codes are**: 0 us, and figures 1 to 3 for the other
  slots in order, skipping ours. `wa_lkcanon` becomes a table lookup in
  each direction.
- **A figure is ours or remote**: the host owns its player and the bots;
  every other machine owns only its player. `wa_lkremote` keeps its
  meaning (ZF = 1: another machine's).

## 5. Protocol v2 (the network)

Every v2 body starts with the type, the match tag and the sender's slot.
The checks are v1's: one length per type, the CRC.

- **NSNAP** (type 8), each machine, every 3rd sim tick (10 Hz; the
  network has the bandwidth):
  - its player as v1's SNAP (x, y, z / 2, yaw, the host's lift or the
    pitch, the flags);
  - **damage dealt to each slot**: four cumulative bytes;
  - **who dealt it**, from the host (whose bots shoot): four bytes, the
    slot of the last shooter of each;
  - **the last event applied from each slot**: four bytes, the acks;
  - **the host's bots**, at the end: four bytes each (v1's HSNAP form) for
    the bot slots.
  ~32 bytes; 10 Hz from four machines is about 1.3 KB a second on the wire.
- **NSCORE** (type 9): the sender's rows of deaths by cause (its player's;
  the host's bots' too).
- **NEVENT** (type 10): v1's EVENT with the sender's slot. An event is
  dropped from the queue once **every** player's ack has reached it.
- **Sending**: on UDP to each other player's address (up to 3 unicasts);
  on raw frames, one broadcast frame each (every player on the LAN is in
  the match, and a frame of another match's tag is dropped).
- **Hits**: v1's rule, generalised: the shooter judges its hitscan hits on
  its own view and adds to that victim's damage byte. The victim's
  machine applies it, credited to the sender's slot (or, from the host,
  to the slot it names). A hit on a bot goes to the host the same way:
  the bots' damage bytes are the bot slots'.
- **Silence**: a player silent for 55 ticks is LOST to the others; 5 s
  silent and it is dropped from the match, its figure gone. **The host
  silent ends the match for everyone** ("HOST LEFT"). Migrating the host
  is not in this plan.

## 6. Finding a match: the lobby v2

- **MATCH** (type 11, from a host, once a second, broadcast and to anyone
  who asked): the tag, the arena, the bots, the skill, the slots' players
  (identity and ready), and whether it has started.
- **JOIN** (type 12, from a player who picked a match): its identity. The
  host answers with the next MATCH, naming the slot it gave. A full match
  says so.
- **ASK** (type 13): "who is hosting?", sent by Find (broadcast) and by
  Join IP (to the address). A host answers ASK with MATCH.
- The match list holds up to 4 found matches, each with its source
  address, and drops one silent for 5 s.
- **Start**: the host's Start, with every joined player ready, sends
  MATCH with the started flag. Each joined player goes in on it, as v1's
  guest does on the host's tag.
- **Joining a match already playing** is allowed into a free slot: the
  match goes on, and the newcomer's figure appears to the others at its
  first NSNAP.

## 7. Waves

- [x] **N1 the setup window** (the IP field, its address remembered and the
  match list come with N4, where they have something to do): the lines, the buttons, Keys..., the IP
  field, the settings remembered. Alone and Serial work as now (Serial is
  v1's lobby, shown in the window).
- [x] **N2 UDP for packages** (the verbs; their row is N3's, which runs the
  match over them): SPEC.md 72.24, the three verbs, the queue,
  and a host check. Its row: two QEMUs exchanging datagrams through the
  relay, which also answers DHCP.
- [ ] **N3 protocol v2 and slots**: NSNAP, NSCORE, NEVENT, the
  generalised codes, hits, acks and silence. Over UDP and over raw frames.
- [ ] **N4 the lobby v2**: ASK, MATCH, JOIN, the list, Start, joining a
  match playing, Join IP.
- [ ] **N5 the rows**: three and four QEMUs on the relay (a hub now): a
  four-player match (each sees the other three, a kill across machines,
  the boards agree), 2 players and 2 bots on UDP, Join IP, Find, a player
  dropped, the host gone. The serial and E1 rows still pass.

## 8. Costs to record as they land

- The window: its bytes, against the help text it replaces.
- ETHER.DRV: the verbs' bytes and the queue's.
- On the 8088: v2 sends to up to three peers and receives from three.
  MartyPC has no NIC; 86Box (`vm/xt-wire`) is the nearest, not
  cycle-accurate.

## 9. As built

### 9.1 N1: the match setup (2026-11-14)

- **`apps/wirearena/wasetup.inc`**:
  - Five settings, Arena, Bots, Skill, Width and Play (alone, serial
    cable, Ethernet), each a value between `<` and `>`.
  - Up and Down move the focus, which is drawn as an inverted row; Left
    and Right change the value, and so does a click on either half of the
    row.
  - Two os88ui buttons: Play (alone) or Ready / Not ready (linked), and
    Keys.
  - Keys fills the rows with the key list (eleven lines, from the old
    fifteen) and hides the buttons; a key or a click goes back.
- **The rows are walink.inc's**: built as text, compared, and drawn with
  `font_run` only where they changed. The buttons are redrawn only when a
  label changes. The players' rows (YOU and the other) sit under the
  buttons once linked.
- **The window opens on no carrier.** The cable's search starts when Play
  says serial, the card is claimed when it says Ethernet, and both are let
  go when it says alone. Before, the window searched the cable as soon as
  it opened.
- **Bots: 0 to 3 alone, 0 to 2 linked** (four participants). The setup's
  count is `wa_lknb` in every mode now: alone, figures past it stay off
  the board as in a linked match. A bench keeps its three dummies.
- **A joined player's arena, bots and skill are the host's**: the row
  says "(host)", and changing one toasts "The host picks the arena".
- **It fits a CGA's 200 lines**: the window is 160 high at y = 20, the
  buttons under the settings. A first layout put them under fifteen rows
  of text, below the dock, where a CGA could not show them. The font has
  no triangles, hence `<` and `>`.
- **The Game and Link menus keep their items.** The solo rows still start
  from the Game menu, and it starts with the setup's bot count.
- **Found on the way**: the CRC's table was built only when a serial port
  opened. With the window no longer opening one, both machines on
  Ethernet computed CRCs from an empty table and agreed with each other.
  The game accepted its own frames; `walink --net`'s independent parser
  (binascii) did not. The table is built when the window opens now.
- **Registered**: `tests/btnsites.txt` (2 record calls). `tests/btnall.py`
  does not drive WireArena's buttons yet; the link rows drive the setup by
  its keys.
