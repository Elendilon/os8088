# Kernel size pass 11: the record, and what is left for a twelfth

**PASS 11 HAS LANDED** on `kernel-size-p11`, cut from `elendilon` at
`2a05e31f`. The file is named `-P12` for the reason the two records before
it are named one ahead: each pass's record is named for the pass it hands
to. Its companions, and this file repeats none of them:

* **`docs/plans/completed/HANDOFF-KERNEL-SIZE.md`**: pass 1's handoff, still
  the authority on **method**.
* **`docs/plans/completed/HANDOFF-KERNEL-SIZE-P11.md`**: pass 10's record.
* **`docs/plans/completed/ksp11/`**: the seven agents' own notes, one file
  each, written as they decided: every item TAKEN with its bytes on both
  kernels, every item REFUSED with the bytes it would have been and why, and
  the cross-file list. **Read the refused lists before re-proposing
  anything.**
* **`docs/KERNEL-MEMORY.md`**: where the budgets stand, blessed at the close
  of this pass.

## 0. THE BRIEF AND THE OUTCOME

The brief: a RESIDENT kernel size pass **focused on the incoming work** -
what landed on `elendilon` since the last upstream squash (`95f7e971`), and
in practice what landed after pass 10 merged (`112f8f9d`). Some of that work
had size-passed itself (multi-select, twice), most had not. **Any ABI, API
or version added since the squash was free to change or break**, having not
gone live. Other optimisations spotted on the way were in scope. One agent
per concept.

**What the incoming work had cost**, measured per merge with
`tools/kernsize.py --json` (resident = `.text` + `.bss` + `.cold` +
`.lowbss` + `.vgabuf`), against pass 10's close:

| merge | concept | kern_big | kern_small |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `f8ba8eb3` | font-bug: captions beside a covering window's corner (SPEC.md 11.3.4.3) | +92 | 0 |
| `e002a0e9` | video-xms: OSAPI_VOL_TAKE, EMS.DRV's door, xmem (52.1.1, 107) | +209 | +84 |
| `323f0efb` | multi-select (22.27), already passed twice | +797 | 0 |
| `a3818217` | PicoMEM: B: from the card, Restart warm-resets | +40 (`.ovlw` +85) | +40 |
| `42e0db93` | disk-cpu: `dsk_xfer` asks once a run whether a bar is live (18.91.6) | +15 | +15 |
| `bc6b0d87` | ftp-speed: WSEQF_KEEP/CKPT (18.4.9.3), FAT16 free search (18.4.10) | +222 | +114 |
| | **total** | **+1,375** | **+253** |

kern_big's `.cold` had crossed two rungs since pass 10's bless (KERN_SIZE
97,280 -> 98,304).

**The outcome**, base `2a05e31f` against the close:

| | base | close | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **kern_big resident** | 92,495 | **92,219** | **-276** |
| kern_big `.text` / `.bss` / `.cold` | 43,428 / 5,190 / 37,943 | 43,369 / 5,154 / 37,762 | -59 / -36 / -181 |
| kern_big `.ovl` / `.ovlw` | 2,471 / 5,086 | 2,471 / 5,075 | 0 / -11 |
| kern_big `KERN_SIZE` | 98,304 | **97,792** | **-512** (the cold rung uncrossed) |
| **kern_small resident** | 61,442 | **60,314** | **-1,128** (-1.8%) |
| kern_small `.text` / `.bss` / `.cold` | 32,022 / 3,073 / 23,479 | 31,830 / 3,067 / 22,549 | -192 / -6 / -930 |
| kern_small `KERN_SIZE` | 63,488 | **62,976** | **-512** |
| kern_emu resident / `KERN_SIZE` | 92,872 / 98,816 | 92,596 / 98,304 | -276 / -512 |
| `kerndos.bin` | 33,243 | 32,799 | -444 |

Loadable images (UNPACKED image, which is what lives in RAM; the shipped
file is LZ4-packed):

| image | base | close | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `EMS.DRV` | 1,032 | 670 | **-362**, and its claim **2 KB -> 1 KB** on every machine that loads it |
| `HDD.DRV` | 3,748 | 3,568 | -180 (at its floor: §5) |
| `SOUND.DRV` | 6,946 | 6,796 | -150 |
| `USBMOUSE.DRV` | 1,410 | 1,396 | -14 |
| `ETHER.DRV` | 16,400 | 16,392 | -8 |
| `DOCK.DRV` | 2,246 | 2,233 | -13 |
| kern_small `FILECP.DRV` | 1,936 | 1,770 | -166 |
| kern_small `CTRL.DRV` | 4,490 | 4,406 | -84 |
| kern_small `FDLG.DRV` | 1,246 | 1,232 | -14 |
| kern_small `CLONE.DRV` | 7,196 | 7,184 | -12 |
| `HDDTOOL.DRV`, `HIBER.DRV`, `CLONE.DRV` (big) | | | 0 (savings fell into `align 512` pads) |

**The merge reproduced the sum of the branches exactly** on both kernels at
every merge (read after each).

## 1. WHO TOOK WHAT

Six concept agents, each in a worktree cut at `2a05e31f` and owning one
merge's code rather than a set of files (shared files - `disk.inc` had three
owners - were split by hunk, and nothing collided but `docs/INDEX.md` and one
pair of identical deletions); then a seventh, `xfile`, on the merged tree in
two rounds for the cross-file lists.

| agent | concept | big | small |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| **diskwrite** | ftp-speed + disk-cpu, pass 10's relaxed jumps, the DMA-bounce row | -88 | -57 |
| **multisel** | multi-select's third pass (797 -> **755**), `fm_onkey_x`'s eleven relaxed jumps | -79 | -11 |
| **voltake** | video-xms's kernel side; kern_small's driver-volume slots | -55 | -440 |
| **caption** | the caption fix, `wm_clip_rows` | -28 | -8 |
| **picomem** | PicoMEM in the kernel and three drivers, `sbl_isr` | -5 | -5 |
| **drivers** | `EMS.DRV`, `HDD.DRV` | 0 | 0 |
| **xfile** | the cross-file lists: kern_small's redirector arms, relaxed jumps, `lea sp` | -21 | -607 |
| **total** | | **-276** | **-1,128** |

### 1.1 What the incoming work came to

* **font-bug** (+92): -28, and SPEC.md 11.3.4.3 records why kern_small does
  not carry the grow at all. Proved equivalent to the base under unicorn
  over 30,000 cases per kernel; every path runs fewer instructions.
* **video-xms** (+209 / +84): the VOL_TAKE half is +66 of `.cold` with
  **`OSAPI_VOL_TAKE` (0x0467) RETIRED** - a take is `OSAPI_VOL_ADD` with DX
  != 0 (DL = the index `OSAPI_VOL_AT` answered), which main's SDK had marked
  "RESERVED, pass 0" - and the take and give-back are each one word store,
  DV_KIND and DV_UNIT adjacent. `DRVC_EMS` keeps no 36-byte table copy: its
  one cell rides in `drv_fptr7`'s offset half, and `OSAPI_DRV_CALL` got
  ~16 cycles faster for every other class. `HDD.DRV` follows the new ABI,
  `HD_ABI_VER` 4 -> 5 (shared only with `HDDTOOL.DRV`).
* **multi-select** (+797): 755 now. `MSELOFF=1` is the feature's A/B and no
  longer byte-identical to the pre-feature kernel, since pass 11 re-laid
  code the feature shares; CLAUDE.md's knob row says so.
* **PicoMEM** (+40 / ovlw +85): +35 / +74; `dsk_fdd_park_x` out of
  `kern_dos`, where it was dead (-60 there).
* **disk-cpu** (+15): left as is, already minimal (`ksp11/diskwrite.md`).
* **ftp-speed** (+222 / +114): -42 on both kernels from the FAT16 search
  sharing `dskw_alloc`'s wrap (checked against the old loop in a model over
  20,000 FATs) and -31 from KEEP/CKPT. kern_big paid twice because KEEP/CKPT
  is part of WRITE_SEQ, which kern_small does not have.

### 1.2 The shapes that recurred

* **Dead on one kernel only.** The largest single result is kern_small's:
  no driver class is ever published there, so `osapi_vol_fence` could never
  let anyone through - and eleven redirector arms, four zero-filled driver
  tables, a thunk, two fenced file cells, the VOL slots and six FILECP.DRV
  arms were still assembled behind it (voltake -418, xfile -607). Each slot
  is now a label on an existing refusal stub; a redirected arm added there
  later fails to assemble instead of silently calling a refusal. SPEC.md
  51.0.2 and 62.9.2.3 say so.
* **An unpublished cell folded into a published one's reserved register**
  (`OSAPI_VOL_TAKE` into `OSAPI_VOL_ADD`'s DX).
* **A table copy the kernel kept of a driver's table it reads one cell of**
  (`DRVC_EMS`), and on the driver's side a 256-byte page-owner table that a
  contiguous-run allocator never needed (`EMS.DRV` -506 of image+bss).
* **Relaxed jumps, again** - `fm_onkey_x` alone had eleven. The margins left
  are thin (Ctrl+A's jump is 126 bytes from its body): any growth there will
  relax one again without a word. The xfile sweep left 83 hits on kern_big
  and 30 on kern_small, each with its reason (`ksp11/xfile.md`): most are
  the software-renderer dispatch, `gfx_blit4`'s per-run loop and `font_run`,
  where the short form costs cycles.
* **A jump table for a compare chain** (`HDD.DRV`'s `hd_svc`, twelve
  compares, nine of them relaxed: -33).
* **Register banks a callee did not need**, single-caller routines written
  at their call site, and a `.bss` word dropped where its twin held the same
  value (`[pm_sbport]`) - pass 10's shapes, still paying.

## 2. HOT PATHS

None got slower; the ones that moved, moved down. `wm_clip_rows` (once per
clipped glyph cell) 2-5 instructions fewer on every path; `sbl_isr` 12-14
cycles faster per block IRQ; `OSAPI_DRV_CALL` ~16 cycles faster for every
class but EMS; `HDD.DRV`'s per-sector DRQ exit one instruction shorter, the
`rep insw` loop unchanged; `gfx_blit1_x`'s teardown `lea sp, [bp+18]` ~8
clocks once per call (`tools/stkbalance.py` reads the form now, with a
fixture). The costs paid on purpose, all once per operation: the FAT12
allocation scan one compare per candidate on the first allocation after a
mount (~24 cycles); `fm_mset`/`fm_mdraw` through `kentc_di` (~40 cycles a
gesture); `dsk_xfer`'s write-protect refusal +16 cycles on that error path.
`sch_switch`, `sch_isr`, the API cell, `font_run` and `dsk_xfer`'s
per-sector path are untouched.

## 3. DEFECTS FOUND

### 3.1 A driver move left two classes' published segments behind (FIXED)

`93287205`, 0 bytes. `memory.inc`'s relocation row `MEM_RR_ROW drv_fseg, 5,
4` covered five driver classes; `DRVC_POINT` (6, on main) and `DRVC_EMS` (7,
this round) were added without it. A compaction that moved `EMS.DRV` (it
hooks no vector, so it may move) left `drv_fseg7` naming freed memory, and
every `OSAPI_DRV_CALL` to it and the `EMSV_GONE` call at every instance
teardown far-called there; the USB mouse's packets would be refused. The row
counts `DRVC_MAX` now and `tests/drvmove.py` checks all seven. **Found by
reading; not reproduced** - no row moves `EMS.DRV`.

### 3.2 Leaving a DOS program on a PicoMEM machine (NOT fixed: the owner's call)

`kerndos/kdentry.inc`'s `kd_leave` ends in `int 19h` with no PicoMEM check,
which is the path SPEC.md 18.100.1 fixed for the desktop's Restart. It
plausibly hangs the same way. ~35 bytes of the DOS program; no field report
and nothing here can test it.

### 3.3 Behaviour changes taken on purpose

* A kept WRITE_SEQ hold that hops off its volume and back within one wake
  commits at the next unlock instead of staying (the safe direction; SPEC.md
  18.4.9.3).
* `drv_load_row` asks one-driver-per-class FIRST, so a row both duplicate and
  missing answers `DRVE_TWICE` where it answered `DRVE_NOENT` (SPEC.md
  51.2.1).
* `HSV_MOUNT`/`HSV_VOLOF` pointed at a partition the kernel already carries
  takes it over instead of adding a second volume; the installer refuses that
  target, so nothing reaches it today.

## 4. WHAT WAS RUN

* Every agent: `make`, `make small` and the fast tier (61/61) after every
  batch, `make emu` at its tip, `checkdocs`, and `tools/stkbalance.py` over
  the files it touched, base against tip (no new unbalanced path anywhere;
  the tool learned `jmp far` to a literal address and `lea sp, [bp+N]`, each
  with a QUIET and a LOUD fixture in `tests/unit/t_stkbalance.py`). The
  coordinator rebuilt and read `kernsize` after every merge.
* Per-agent soak rows - about 120 distinct, all green (each agent's note
  lists them). Two scratch unicorn harnesses proved equivalence where no
  emulator has the hardware or no row reaches the path: `wm_clip_rows`
  (30,000 cases per kernel) and `picomem.inc` (4,322 scenarios, port traces
  identical in order). `tests/dskwstage.py` gained **the DMA-bounce row
  passes 9 and 10 asked for**: WRITE_AT and READ_AT through a buffer 0xF0
  short of a 64 KB page, broken on purpose twice and red both times.
* **The integration soak**: §4.1.

### 4.1 The integration soak

On the merged tree at `c6ba7e8d`, `tools/os88soak.py start` scoped to every
subject the pass touched - 160 rows (the union of the agents' rows, each
subject's neighbours, every `small*`, `kd*`, `hd*`, `fdlg*`, `fm*`, `fcp*`,
`wseq*`, `heap*`, `reg*`, `rehome*`, `covox*`, `ems*`, `videms*` row): **158
ok, 1 FAIL, 1 SKIP** in 34 minutes at width 4. The skip is `instkeep` (the
box has no `mtools`). The failure is **`regrowshed`, red at the base
`2a05e31f` with the same signature** (`loaded` and `toobig`; re-run there
alone), as pass 10 recorded it at its own base: its staging no longer fills
the 128 KB machine's heap. The whole soak tier was not run: it is the
owner's to ask for.

The full tier on the same tree: **67/67** (it boots kern_small on its
128 KB floor machine and both 1bpp adapters, `kernresident`, `ctoolchain`,
`ps2mouse`). `soak -k buildmatrix` (every knob kernel and every knob module,
both arms): **ok** - no module crossed a KB boundary downward with its bss on
top, which is what broke `ANIMOFF=1` in pass 10.

## 5. WHAT IS LEFT

* **`HDD.DRV` is at its floor**: 3,072 + max(512, the attach-only code laid
  under `hd_mbr`). Smaller resident savings only widen the pad until ~280
  more bytes come out of the resident part, which would take it to a 3 KB
  claim.
* **The relaxed-jump remainder** (`ksp11/xfile.md`'s table): HIBER.DRV holds
  ~45 bytes of them, and `gfx_blit4`'s per-run loop wants a hoist that is a
  speed job first.
* **The 2A3h PicoMEM ramp exists in four places** (park, `pmemu`, SOUND,
  USBMOUSE) and cannot be shared without a published cell.
* **`xm_release_rec` on kern_small** (9 bytes), left by xmem.inc's own rule
  that teardown sites stay unconditional.
* Carried from pass 10 §5, untouched and still the owner's: `rect_get` /
  `rect_put` at the damage-repaint and save-under sites (-138), and the
  module bss assertion's general fix (no module crossed a KB boundary
  downward with bss on top in this pass; `buildmatrix` is the row that says
  so).

## 6. METHOD LESSONS

* **Agents by CONCEPT rather than by file worked**, with hunk ownership in
  shared files. Three agents edited `disk.inc` and the merges were clean;
  the one overlap (two agents deleting the same two `equ` aliases) resolved
  as either side.
* **The follow-up agent earned its round twice**: the cross-file lists were
  worth -607 on kern_small, more than any concept agent. Give it
  a second round once the files it was barred from are free.
* **A ratchet for one kernel arm is worth looking for**: the biggest bytes
  were code whose GUARD said "never on this kernel" while the code behind it
  was still assembled there. `grep` for a refusal stub whose callers all
  sit behind a test that cannot pass on that arm.
* **Do not run a row while editing kernel sources in the same tree**: two
  rows failed in `os88sym` ("the map describes a DIFFERENT kernel") for that
  reason alone and were green on a frozen re-run.
