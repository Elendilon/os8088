; os8088 - apps/wirearena/wrpart.asm - WireArena's RENDERER PART
;
; Part 0 of WARENA.O88 (docs/plans/WIREARENA-PARTS-PLAN.md section 7; the
; parts standard is SPEC.md 20.12). An OP_SEG part assembled at org 0 that
; carries its own data and is entered with DS = its data segment - XTMP3's
; FRONT shape (apps/xtmp3/x3front.asm): a header naming its verbs, the FRAME
; BLOCK the primary stages into (apps/wirearena/wafb.inc), then the renderer
; (wrender.inc, included UNCHANGED), its tables, the sine table and the
; keyframes it reads in place, and its BSS - the arenas are parts of their
; own (rows 1.., WIREARENA-PARTS-PLAN 7.5), copied in by ARENA - shipped as zeros that OP_ZFILL
; neither stores nor decodes (SPEC.md 20.12.7.5).
;
; THE RULES THIS PART KEEPS, because the primary declares its claim movable
; and kern_mega runs it through a code alias (SPEC.md 20.12.5, 20.12.12):
;   - it calls NO kernel slot, so nothing claims under a far call into it and
;     the carve may move whenever the primary is not inside it;
;   - it reads and writes nothing through CS: every table is read through DS
;     (under kern_mega the CS of a part is an execute-only alias);
;   - it does no segment arithmetic: the only segments it holds are DS (its
;     own, from the primary) and the video segment out of the frame block.
; Labels are wa_ (the renderer's own, as in the primary) and wr_ (this file's).
