; os8088 - apps/fptest/fptest.asm
;
; The test app for apps/os88fp.inc, and the reason that file can be trusted
; before a single cell in Sheet depends on it.
;
; Floating point is the worst possible thing to debug from inside a
; spreadsheet: a wrong bit in the guard region shows up as a value that is
; merely a little off, in one cell, on some inputs. So the soft-float core is
; proven HERE first, against real IEEE-754, and only then wired into Sheet.
;
; Every expected double in apps/fptest/fpcases.inc was GENERATED ON THE HOST,
; computed in double precision and emitted as exact bytes. That is the whole
; point: the reference is not my own arithmetic restated in assembly, it is
; what a real IEEE-754 implementation produced. A case only passes if all
; EIGHT bytes match.
;
; The cases cover carrying, cancellation, mixed signs, wildly different
; exponents, the classic 0.1+0.2, quotients that do not terminate (1/3, 2/3),
; ties broken only by bits lost below the working form, the overflow clamp,
; division by zero (CF asserted too, not just the bytes), the subnormal flush,
; sqrt/trunc/floor/round, text -> double, and text -> double -> text.
;
; ONE RUNNER, FOUR HANDLERS (the first apps size pass). The four kinds of case
; were four copies of the same loop - run, pack, compare eight bytes, place a
; row, draw a verdict - and are now one walk over fpcases.inc's groups that
; calls a handler per record. Every case is checked exactly as before.
