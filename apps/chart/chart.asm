; os8088 - apps/chart/chart.asm
;
; CHART, a standalone bar-chart viewer: File > Open... reads a real SYLK,
; DIF or BIFF file (dispatched by its extension, exactly like Sheet's own
; sh_doread) and renders the FIRST NUMERIC COLUMN it finds as a bar chart;
; File > Export as BMP... saves the rendered chart as a real graphics file
; for use in other software. Launch is via the standard Open dialog, not
; double-click file association - there is no cross-app spawn API anywhere
; in this OS (confirmed by an exhaustive apps/os88api.inc search), so
; association would only add complexity to a launch path that still
; requires going through the Locator either way.
;
; Deliberately does NOT reuse Sheet's own SYLK/DIF/BIFF reader code
; (apps/sheet/sheet.asm's sh_doread_sylk/sh_doread_dif/sh_doread_biff):
; this app reads files it did NOT write, so a reader that (like Sheet's
; own DIF reader) assumes its own writer's exact fixed shape would be
; unsafe here. The one exception is ct_rkdec below, a verbatim duplicate
; of sheet.asm's sh_rkdec - a tiny, fully self-contained 4-byte-value
; decode with no dependency on anything else in that file, so duplicating
; it exactly is cheap and safe where reusing a whole reader would not be.
;
; Rendering and BMP export are shared with Sheet's own live "Data > Chart
; Column..." window via apps/os88chart.inc (ch_bars_draw/ch_bmp_write) -
; see that file's own header for the offscreen-buffer design this is
; built on (there is no pixel-readback API in this OS, so both the
; on-screen chart and the exported file come from one rasterized buffer).

; at all (ct_expdlg) - so an open Chart holds 19KB of heap where it held 51.

; in DX. Stage 4.6: a cell holds an IEEE-754 double, and truncating it here
; was the whole of why 43.6 charted as a bar of 43 (82.13). All registers
; preserved.
;
; THE CAP USED TO BOUND THE SCAN, AND THAT LOST DATA SILENTLY. Each reader
; collected every numeric cell it met into the temp arrays, stopped at CT_TCAP
; of them, and only then did ct_finalize pick the lowest column and filter to
; it. On a wide sheet the temp arrays filled with OTHER columns' cells, so two
; things went wrong at once and neither announced itself: the tail of the
; chosen column was never read, and - worse - the lowest column was derived
; from a truncated sample, so a lower column appearing later in the file was
; never seen and THE WRONG COLUMN WAS CHARTED. Both produced a plausible chart.
;
; So the filter runs as the file is read instead. The lowest column seen so far
; is the series; a cell BELOW it restarts the collection, a cell IN it is
; appended, a cell ABOVE it is offered to the second series. One pass still,
; no second read, and the cap bounds the KEPT SERIES rather than the scanned
; candidates - which is why it is CH_MAXBARS here and not CT_TCAP.
;
; WHAT IS KEPT IS ONLY WHAT IS READ AGAIN (size pass 1): a row per cell of
; series one, because ct_finalize sorts by it, and the doubles of both. A
; column word per cell went (every cell of a series is in ct_mincol by
; construction), and so did series two's rows, which nothing ever read - it is
; drawn in the order the file gave it, exactly as before. And what is kept is
; kept in the STAGING claim, at ES:CT_A_* (ES is that claim for as long as a
; reader runs), not in the package's bss: none of it outlives the read.

; ct_finalize - the shared last step for all three readers: sort series one by
; row ascending, IN PLACE, then scale both series' doubles into the words the
; drawing runs on, and copy those words - the only thing the read leaves
; behind - out of the staging claim into ct_w2vals/ct_wvals.
; in: ES = the staging claim. out: ES = DS. Clobbers DI.
;
; ct_record already keeps only the lowest column (and caps it at CH_MAXBARS),
; so all this has left to do is order it - and it orders the rows and doubles where
; they stand. It used to copy them into a second set of arrays (ct_vrow,
; ct_vals: 400 bytes) to sort the copy, which bought nothing: nothing reads
; the unsorted order afterwards. The sort is the same insertion sort, stable,
; so the order it produces is the same.
;
; A read that never reaches a reader (the file would not stage) never gets
; here, so the chart on screen and the words it was drawn from stay together.

; So it stays a literal and this asserts it. A mismatch drives one of the two
; TIMES counts negative, which -w+error turns into a build failure naming the
; exact shortfall; both are zero when the literal is right, so nothing is
; emitted. READ THE LINE NUMBER, not just the sign - the two report the same
; shortfall with opposite signs, so which one fired is what says whether the
; literal is too small or too large.
