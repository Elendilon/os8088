; renders an editable specimen in the selected face (SPEC.md 90).  It is a
; normal package, carried in APPS/ on the system disk; the F88 declaration in
; its header is all the file manager needs to launch it from a face file.

; OS88_ICON16 block are at fixed offsets in the image (SPEC.md 20.2) and code
; emitted between them fails the icon macro's offset assertion.
;
; NOBTN because this card draws no button and no scroll bar - the card IS the
; only control this package takes, and without the opt-out every package
; carrying the include pays 116 bytes for a glyph nothing calls.
